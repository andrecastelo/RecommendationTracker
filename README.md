Recommendation Tracker
======================

This application was designed to track which clients were recommended by which
collaborators, making it easy to reward the ones with the best performance.

This isn't a very complex app and perhaps there could be a lot of different,
simpler implementations and solutions to this problem, but I wanted to work on
a project using [Flask](http://flask.pocoo.org/) and the [Twitter Bootstrap](http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/).
